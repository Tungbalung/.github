### **Why You Should Switch from PopcornTime to Legal Alternatives**

PopcornTime’s peer-to-peer (P2P) streaming may seem convenient, but it exposes users to significant risks:

-   Malware infections and phishing attacks through fake clones
    
-   Legal consequences for accessing pirated torrents
    
-   Privacy violations as ISPs can track P2P activities
    

Using legitimate platforms not only ensures a safe and smooth streaming experience but also supports content creators in a legal and ethical way.
